    	<h1><p>Air Sprayer :</p></h1>
		<p>A sprayer is a device used to spray a liquid.
	In agriculture, a sprayer is a piece of equipment that is used to apply herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers on agricultural crops. Sprayers range in size from man-portable units (typically backpacks with spray guns) to trailed sprayers that are connected to a tractor, to self-propelled units similar to tractors, with boom mounts of 60–151 feet in length.</p>
    
    <P>These use air pressure and fluid pressure 300 to 3,000 pounds per square inch (2,100–20,700 kPa) to achieve atomization of the coating. This equipment provides high transfer and increased application speed and is most often used with flat-line applications in factory finish shops.</P>

     <P>The fluid pressure is provided by an airless pump, which allows much heavier materials to be sprayed than is possible with an airspray gun. Compressed air is introduced into the spray via an air nozzle (sometimes called air cap) similar to a standard conventional spray gun. The addition of compressed air improves the fineness of atomization. Additionally unlike a pure airless spray gun, an AA gun has some control over fan spray to round spray. Some electric airless sprayers Wagner and Graco) are fitted with a compressor to allow the use of an air-assisted airless gun in situations where portability is important.</P>
