    <h1> National Agriculture Technology Development Society </h1>
    	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Established in 2008 with its headquarters at the Ganpat University, Ahmedabad. The society develop by Computer Science Engineering Students. The Society of Agricultural Professionals (SAP) is a non-profit scientific society committed to promote need based result oriented research and education in the changing agricultural scenario and thereby improving living standard of farmers, establish close association among agricultural professionals of and dissemination of research results by publishing a half yearly periodical "Current Advances in Agricultural Sciences – An International Journal”.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It holds National and International Conferences from time to time on burning topics on agriculture. The latest one was the National Symposium on Transforming Indian Agriculture towards Food and Nutritional Security (IAFNS 2016). The SAP has instituted various awards to recognize agricultural scientists/teachers.</p>

    <h2>History Agriculture:-</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first people to turn from the hunting and gathering lifestyle to farming probably relied on their bare hands, perhaps aided by sticks and stones. Once tools such as knives, scythes, and plows were developed, they dominated agriculture for thousands of years. During this time, most people worked in agriculture, because each family could barely raise enough food for themselves with the limited technology of the day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the coming of the Industrial Revolution and the development of more complicated machines, farming methods took a great leap forward. Instead of harvesting grain by hand with a sharp blade, wheeled machines cut a continuous swath. Instead of threshing the grain by beating it with sticks, threshing machines separated the seeds from the heads and stalks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These machines required a lot of power, which was originally supplied by horses or other domesticated animals. With the invention of steam power came the steam-powered tractor, a multipurpose, mobile energy source that was the ground-crawling cousin of the steam locomotive. Agricultural steam engines took over the heavy pulling work of horses. They were also equipped with a pulley that could power stationary machines via the use of a long belt. The steam-powered behemoths could provide a tremendous amount of power, because of both their size and their low gear ratios.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next generation of tractors was powered by gasoline (and later) diesel engines. These engines also contributed to the development of the self-propelled, combined harvester and thresher—or combine, for short. Instead of cutting the grain stalks and transporting them to a stationary threshing machine, these combines could cut, thresh, and separate the grain while moving continuously through the field.</p>

<h2>Other Information of Agriculture Technology :-</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information and communication technology in agriculture (ICT in agriculture), also known as e-agriculture, is developing and applying innovative ways to use ICTs in the rural domain, with a primary focus on agriculture. ICT in agriculture offers a wide range of solutions to some agricultural challenges. It is seen as an emerging field focusing on the enhancement of agricultural and rural development through improved information and communication processes. In this context, ICT is used as an umbrella term encompassing all information and communication technologies including devices, networks, mobiles, services and applications; these range from innovative Internet-era technologies and sensors to other pre-existing aids such as fixed telephones, televisions, radios and satellites. E-agriculture continues to evolve in scope as new ICT applications continue to be harnessed in the agriculture sector. More specifically, e-agriculture involves the conceptualization, design, development, evaluation and application of innovative ways to use ICTs in the rural domain, with a primary focus on agriculture. Provisions of standards, norms, methodologies, and tools as well as development of individual and institutional capacities, and policy support are all key components of e-agriculture.</p>

	<h2>Computer-controlled devices (automated systems) :- </h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It systems are computer controlled stand alone systems that milk the dairy cattle without human labor. The complete automation of the milking process is controlled by an agricultural robot, a complex herd management software, and specialized computers. Automatic milking eliminates the farmer from the actual milking process, allowing for more time for supervision of the farm and the herd. Farmers can also improve herd management by using the data gathered by the computer. By analyzing the effect of various animal feeds on milk yield, farmers may adjust accordingly to obtain optimal milk yields. Since the data is available down to individual level, each cow may be tracked and examined, and the farmer may be alerted when there are unusual changes that could mean sickness or injuries.</p>
    
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agricultural machinery is machinery used in farming or other agriculture. There are many types of such equipment, from hand tools and power tools to tractors and the countless kinds of farm implements that they tow or operate. Diverse arrays of equipment are used in both organic and nonorganic farming. Especially since the advent of mechanised agriculture, agricultural machinery is an indispensable part of how the world is fed. (Prasad and chathura of FOT). Before sownih the seeds, it is necessary to break soil clumps to get better yield. This is done with the help of various tools. Tha main tools are Plough and Hoe.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Open source agricultural equipment :-</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many farmers are upset by their inability to fix the new types of high-tech farm equipment. This is due mostly to companies using intellectual property law to prevent farmers from having the legal right to fix their equipment (or gain access to the information to allow them to do it). In October 2015 an exemption was added to the DMCA to allow inspection and modification of the software in cars and other vehicles including agricultural machinery.</p>
